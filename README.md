# Tetris
## An HTML/CSS/JavaScript Tetris game

### Features:
* Pieces drop at random
* WASD controls
* Lines clear
* Each cleared line is recorded as a point in your score

### Challenges: 
* I had a hard time finding where to start. I play a lot of Tetris so I knew how it was supposed to look and feel, but starting was the hardest part.
* I had to learn more about HTML canvas. I had only heard of it in passing before this project so I had to dive in and learn what I needed to know to make this game work.
* JavaScript has become my preferred language, but while I was making this project, my understanding was very fundamental. This project forced me to think less about the bigger picture and more about the pieces that make it. Breaking down and compartmentalizing things as small and important as pieces falling and making sure the pieces know when to stop. In short, it broadened the scope of my thought process, taught me to think more like a programmer, and made me work on something more complex than I was used to.

### Features In Development
* The high score recording is not currently functional. I would like to have a top 3 leaderboard with names and scores stored in a SQL database and rendered dynamically after a game is completed.
* I would like to refine the gameplay a little more. At times it feels a little too slow, at other times it feels too fast. I've started to wonder if the WASD controls are not the best option, but they are functional and generally regarded as standard for computer games. I would also like to add a hold function.
* I personally think its a little ugly and would like to design a more pleasing UI while retaining the current functionality of the game.
* I had a few ideas for 'powerup pieces' that would spawn at set intervals and perform actions when lines were cleared with them; i.e: clearing the bottom 5 rows. Still brainstorming these, but it is a feature I would like to add, maybe as an option the player can toggle on and off at the beginning of the game.
